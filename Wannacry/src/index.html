          <h2>What Happend to My Computer?</h2>
          <p>Your important files are encrypted. Many of your documents, photos, videos, databases, and other files are no longer accessible because they have been encrypted. Maybe you are busy looking for a way to recover your files, but don't waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without our decryption service.</p>
          <h2>Can I recover my files?</h2>
          <p>Sure, we guarantee that you can recover all your files safely and easily. But you have not so enough time.</p>
          <h2>How do I pay?</h2>
          <p>Payment is accepted in Bitcoin only. For more information, contact us at <span class="contact-info">[email_address]</span> or <span class="contact-info">[website_address]</span>.</p>
          <p>All your files have been encrypted using military-grade encryption algorithms. There is no way to recover your files without our decryption service.</p>
          <p>Do not attempt to modify or delete the ransomware or your files will be permanently lost. Only we have the decryption key to recover your files.</p>
          <p>If you want to get your files back, you must pay the ransom in Bitcoin. Payment instructions are provided below.</p>
          <h2>How to pay the ransom?</h2>
          <p>Payment is accepted in Bitcoin only. For more information and payment instructions, contact us at <span class="contact-info">[email_address]</span> or visit our website <span class="contact-info">[website_address]</span>.</p>
          <p>Once the payment is received, you will receive the decryption key to unlock your files.</p>
          <p>Do not delay the payment. The ransom amount will increase if you delay. You have [countdown_timer] to make the payment before your files are permanently lost.</p>
